"""The paged-KV attention leaf: the kernel-facing contract.

A ``PagedAttentionBackend`` serves the layers of exactly one cache group and
perceives exactly what a paged attention kernel perceives — a kernel page
table, cache sequence lengths and write slots. It never sees cache groups,
scheduler block tables, the pool's contract or which side (target/draft)
it runs on beyond the ``is_draft`` verify-floor geometry. The
``CacheGroupRouter`` owns all of that and hands every leaf a fully resolved
``page_table`` (kernel pages, batch-ordered, padded to ``[bs,
max_num_pages]``) on every metadata call; the leaf copies it into its own
graph-recorded buffers. This is the interface the backends had before cache
groups existed, minus the scheduler-table gather the router now performs.
