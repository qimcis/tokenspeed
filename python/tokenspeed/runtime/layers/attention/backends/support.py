    decisions to derive from replicated state). ``decode_graph=False``
    disables capture/replay of the whole-step decode graph — the unified
    refresh still serves eager decode, so ``init_cuda_graph_state`` and
    ``refresh_decode_metadata`` stay mandatory. ``prefill_graph=False``
    disables the breakable prefill (extend) graph. Static "never works"
    declarations only — and they are the ONLY escape: a prefill capture
    failure at runtime is fatal, so a family that cannot capture must say
    so here rather than rely on a degrade path.
