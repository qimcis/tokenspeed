"""Breakable CUDA graph capture for variable-shape (prefill / extend) forwards.

A *breakable* CUDA graph captures a forward as an ordered list of zero-arg
callables -- each is either a captured ``CUDAGraph.replay`` (a "graph segment")
or an eager Python function (a "break"). At designated break points (attention /
KV-cache ops and data-dependent MoE operations) the current stream capture is
ended, the eager body or its construction-only stub runs, and a fresh segment
begins capturing the remainder. Replay calls each segment in order, always
running the real eager body.

This is the ``torch.compile``-free alternative to piecewise CUDA graphs. The
design is gratefully adapted from vLLM and SGLang, who pioneered the breakable
prefill graph: vLLM's ``BreakableCUDAGraphWrapper`` (the homogeneous segment-list
structure + the ``set_forward_context``/``get_forward_context`` ambient pattern we
mirror in :func:`active_forward`/:func:`current_forward_ctx`) and SGLang's
breakable prefill graph (the eager-copy output handoff at each break). Unlike a
full prefill graph, attention -- the source of the host-side ``max_seq_len_q``
scalar -- stays eager, so it never enters a graph.
Keeping all KV-cache reads/writes in the eager breaks also makes them honor the
per-layer transfer consumer index naturally.

Address-stability contract (the load-bearing invariant):

* All segments share one CUDA mempool, so graph-allocated intermediates keep
  stable device addresses across replays.
* The runner must copy live inputs into the *same* static input buffers used at
  capture before calling :meth:`BreakableCapture.replay`.
* Break-point outputs must land at the *same* address each replay. We achieve
  this by allocating a destination buffer in the captured segment (pool-pinned)
  and copying the eager op's result into it; the next segment reads that address.

    the surrounding token-shaped compute (norms, projections, collectives) is
    captured around it automatically, while everything inside the method stays

    output** at capture time (the break runs during capture regardless), so no

    q-shaped vs GDN z-shaped). Buffers live in a per-capture shape-keyed cache
    (:attr:`BreakableCapture._handoff`), shared across same-shape breaks. That
    sharing relies on break outputs having strictly sequential lifetimes -- break
    K's output is consumed by K's following segment before break K+1 runs (true
    for transformer topology, where attention output feeds the adjacent
    o-proj/residual). A model whose break output is read by a LATER segment must
    not share its shape with an intervening break, or replay silently corrupts.

    their capture-time value -- route per-request quantities through ``ctx`` / metadata.
