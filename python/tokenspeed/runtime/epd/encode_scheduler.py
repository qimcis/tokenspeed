"""Encode-stage batching for EPD transfer.

The encode server runs the vision tower only, orchestrated in Python rather
than the C++ KV scheduler, so all it needs is to batch pending vision items
into a single ViT forward under a token budget -- that is
:class:`EncodeScheduler` below.

The duplicate-image cache lives in
:mod:`tokenspeed.runtime.cache.embedding_cache`. The two are decoupled: the
encode loop checks the cache on arrival and feeds only *misses* to the
scheduler.

    ``(request_id, item_index)`` -- so every rank forms an identical ViT batch.
    This matters because the vision tower can be tensor-parallel; non-identical
    batches across ranks would deadlock the NCCL collectives inside it.

    Greedy packing: items are admitted in order until the next one would exceed
    ``max_tokens_per_batch`` or ``max_items_per_batch``. A single item whose
