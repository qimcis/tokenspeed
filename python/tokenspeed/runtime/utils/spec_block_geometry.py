"""Block geometry shared by the DSpark and DFlash speculative families.

A block drafter's native width is fixed by its checkpoint. DSpark stores the
drafted-token count; DFlash/DFlash2 store the anchor-plus-proposals width.
The target may consume a shorter prefix without changing the native forward.
