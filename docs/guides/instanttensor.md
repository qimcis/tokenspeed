# Loading Weights with InstantTensor

[InstantTensor](https://github.com/scitix/InstantTensor) accelerates loading
safetensors weights on NVIDIA GPUs through distributed loading, pipelined
prefetching, and direct I/O. It also supports GPUDirect Storage (GDS) when
available, which lets it fully utilize the bandwidth of high-speed networked
storage (e.g. 400 Gbps).

InstantTensor only changes *how* the safetensors shards are read off disk and
moved onto the GPU — the resulting weights are bit-for-bit identical to the
default safetensors loader, so model accuracy is unaffected.

## Installation

InstantTensor is an optional extra, because PyPI carries x86_64 wheels only:

```bash
pip install "tokenspeed[instanttensor]"
```

On aarch64 hosts (GB200, GB300) there is no published wheel, but the sdist
builds from source in about a minute. The extension reaches CUDA, cuFile, and
NCCL through `dlopen` and vendors its own Boost, libaio, and liburing, so it
needs a C++ toolchain and `make` -- not `nvcc`, and not a matching CUDA
toolkit:

```bash
pip install --no-binary instanttensor "tokenspeed[instanttensor]"
```

This is why the dependency is an extra rather than a core one: as a core
dependency every ARM install would compile it, whether or not the format is
ever requested.

It is imported lazily, so it is loaded only when you select
`--load-format instanttensor`.

## Usage

Pass `--load-format instanttensor`. It works with any parallelism
configuration; when the job spans multiple ranks, the world process group is
handed to InstantTensor so reads are sharded across ranks.

```bash
tokenspeed serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --load-format instanttensor
```

```bash
tokenspeed serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 \
  --load-format instanttensor \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --enable-expert-parallel
```

## Measured effect

Weight-load phase for Kimi-K3 (1.42 TiB over 96 shards, 497k tensors) on two
GB300 nodes with `--tensor-parallel-size 8`, checkpoint on shared storage:

| `--load-format` | weight-load phase |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (safetensors) | 869-1106 s |
| `instanttensor` | 231-234 s |

The ranges are run-to-run variance on the shared filesystem. Both formats
serve identical output, as the loaders are bit-for-bit equivalent.

## Memory considerations

InstantTensor reads each tensor in its input shards **directly onto the GPU**, whereas
the default safetensors loader stages the full tensor in host (CPU) memory and
copies only the current rank's shard to the GPU. InstantTensor's own overhead is
small: it uses a GPU staging buffer (dynamically sized, configurable) that is
released before the KV cache is sized, plus a little fixed runtime overhead, so
its post-load GPU footprint is close to the default loader.

Because tensors land on the GPU, a model's `load_weights` must **consume the
weight iterator lazily** — copying each tensor into its (pre-allocated)
parameter and then releasing it. A `load_weights` that instead collects the
whole iterator into a list keeps every loaded tensor resident on the GPU at once
and will OOM during loading on large models. This stays hidden with the
CPU-staging loaders, where the buffered tensors live in plentiful host RAM.

The gpt-oss MXFP4 path streams its expert tensors for this reason. Paths that
still buffer — notably `_load_normal_weights`, which sorts the iterator, and so
every bf16 gpt-oss checkpoint — hold the whole checkpoint on the device and are
correspondingly limited by GPU memory.

Tuning:

- `INSTANTTENSOR_BUFFER_SIZE` / `INSTANTTENSOR_MAX_FREE_MEM_USAGE` tune
  InstantTensor's GPU I/O staging memory. They do not cap a tensor's allocation:
  InstantTensor enlarges its buffer to hold at least the largest input tensor.
- `--gpu-memory-utilization` only sizes the KV cache *after* weights are loaded;
  it does not change peak memory during loading.

### Models with filtered weights and Engram tables

When a model supplies a checkpoint-name filter, TokenSpeed inspects bounded
safetensors headers before opening a GPU loader. Shards containing only accepted
names use InstantTensor. Mixed shards use CPU safetensors `get_tensor` for accepted
names only, with whole-file prefetch disabled; shards with no accepted names are
skipped. The predicate must select the same files on every rank in the loading
process group. Logs report how many shards use each route.

For DeepSeek V4.1, this is a hybrid loading path: ordinary shards use
InstantTensor, while the small projection tensors sharing Engram shards use
filtered CPU loading. Engram embed weights and scales remain on the model's
existing CPU `get_slice` path, which copies only each TP rank's rows in bounded
chunks. Full Engram tables are never passed to InstantTensor. The checkpoint
requires no rewrite, and the CLI remains `--load-format instanttensor`.

## Notes

- InstantTensor requires NVIDIA GPUs. Requesting it on a non-NVIDIA platform
  raises an error.
- Only `*.safetensors` checkpoints are supported (same shard selection as
  `--load-format safetensors`).
- Checkpoints declaring a sub-byte safetensors dtype (`F4`, `F6_E2M3`,
  `F6_E3M2`) are rejected up front, because InstantTensor reads them at twice
  their true length without raising. This does not affect NVFP4 or MXFP4
  checkpoints that store their packed 4-bit values as byte-aligned `U8` or `I8`.
